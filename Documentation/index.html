      <h2 id="introduction"> <span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Choose a classical electronic game and propose a modern version of it by using natural I/O devices and
        interaction methods – for example, vocal input or interaction via (pseudo-)haptic handheld devices and 3D output
        (i.e. adopting the virtual/augmented reality representations).

      <h3 id="scope"><span>2.1 </span>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to illustrate the process of creating a modern version of a classical electronic
        game, by adding new features and most importantly using natural I/O devices and interaction methods. Simply put,
        classical electronic games refer to the category of “old” simple games with little to no game knowledge
        required, just play and enjoy: Pong, Tetris and PacMan.
      </p>

      <h3 id="conventions"><span>2.2 </span>Theme</h3>
      <p>
        For our theme, we chose the game PacMan, which is normally a top-down platform game, in which the player
        character is always moving, and you use directional input to change directions: Up Down Left Right.
      </p>

      <section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" role="doc-chapter">
        <h2 id="generalDescription"> <span>3. </span>General description</h2>


        <h3 id="productPerspective"> <span>3.1 </span>General description</h3>
        <p>
          For our version, we decided to convert this game to a first-person experience, give full control to the
          player, rethink some of the original game mechanics and finally add a new interaction layer between human and
          computer in the form of audio input and output. This new layer will provide us with a way to add new features
          to gameplay while not removing any of the original feel of the game.
        </p>

        <h3 id="productFunctions"> <span>3.2 </span>Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Changes to the original version of the game:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Game style changed from Top-Down Platformer to First-Person Explorer</li>
          <li>Input modified to better suit the new game style</li>
          <li>Added a Map-Device function which allows the player to view the current state of the game, Map layout,
            Player location, and Score-Points location</li>
          <li>Added a toggleable game mechanic consisting of doors inside the labyrinth walls which can be opened and
            closed from fixed terminals</li>
          <li>Added a toggleable game mechanic consisting of audio interaction, the input of the player can be used to
            redirect and bait the Ghost AI into desired locations and the output consisting of the nearby ghosts will
            give information to the player related to which ghosts are close to the player. The sounds consist of simple
            sound dots and the frequency of the sound being played is related to how aware the player should be around
            each ghost: the faster the dots are heard, the smarter the ghost</li>

      <h2 id="externalRequirements"><span>4. </span>Personas</h2>

      <h3 id="intro"><span>4.1 </span>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        A Persona is a representative of a larger community of potential users, each category being different from the
        other in many aspects, but the main questions we are going to ask are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do we want this person to use our product?</li>
        <li>Will they be able to use it properly? </li>
        <li>How likely is it for them to purchase or recommend it?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While not having precise answers to these questions, using the Personas we can focus our product to satisfy our
        potential users while not wasting resources trying to sell to those who will not buy it.
      </p>
      <p>In the following section, we are going to present 4 different personas, including Primary, Secondary, Negative,
        and Customer personas, and give a scenario example for each user’s interaction with our product. For each of the
        personas excluding the Primary one, we will make a small conclusion that will improve the user experience while
        trying to avoid both technical and social problems thus increasing the selling probability of our product.</p>
      <p>The 4 Personas we are going to describe are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Radu Coptescu</b> - a boy in the 6th class that is at the same time lively and competitive, will
          represent the Primary Persona, a category that we are focusing our product on.</li>
        <li><b>Mihai Ixulescu</b> - a 24 years old student that is focused on his professional life, but did not abandon
          our category of products. While representing the Second Persona, a category that may or may not use our
          product, we will also take into consideration the needs of this persona.</li>
        <li><b>Daniel Zulescu</b> - a 34 years old man, currently working in a Human Resources department. While it is
          highly unlikely that this individual will use our product he might represent the Customer Persona, purchasing
          the product for someone else, like a child. While he is not a user, we still have to consider him as a
          potential buyer and consider it during product development.</li>
        <li><b>Vasile Moș</b> - a 67 years old retired person. This individual has low to no experience using technology
          and is not tolerant of the idea that most products in our day are based on Human-Computer Interaction. He
          represents the Negative Persona, a category that will not be our focus while designing and selling our
          product.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="p1"><span>4.2 </span>Persona 1</h3>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Detailed Description:</li>
        <p>This candidate is our main focus, spending most of his time playing games and competing with others for the
          best score. It is highly likely that this user will recommend our product to many others in order to find new
          competitors.</p>
        <p>In the mentions section there were mentioned many other games that rely on some extent of strategy, but also
          a small inconvenience to randomness. Taking these into account we should make the behaviours of the AI Ghosts
          less randomized or have less importance if their actions are sometimes randomized. (example: do not randomly
          turn around to chase the player”).
        </p>
        <li>Scenarios</li>
        <p>Let us imagine the next series of events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the user was gifted access to our product from his parents</li>
          <li>while playing the game, he noticed some random behaviour from the ghost movement but no major actions were
            randomized.</li>
          <li>after figuring out the map layout and the best routes between points, a high score was achieved.</li>
          <li>eager to become the best player in his group of friends, he started recommending our product.</li>
          <li>our product is now purchased by many more users and the possibility of it being recommended increases
            significantly.</li>

        <p>This candidate plays a major role in the management department of a music store, organizing meetings,
          assigning and checking the task completion of his colleagues. In the mentions section, he stated that in his
          regular breaks, he often takes time to play games on the mobile device, most of which are from the same
          producer. All the mentioned games belong to the Fast-Paced category, multiple stretching to a maximum of 5
          minutes of playtime.</p>
        <p>Also in the mentions section, it was stated that our potential client suffers from colour blindness, a
          setting designed specifically for such disabilities is preferable.
        </p>
        <li>Scenarios</li>
        <p>Let us imagine the next series of events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>our secondary persona decided to try our application on the mobile phone;</li>
          <li>the buy and installation process happened right before work started;</li>
          <li>in a break time the user decided to finally try the game and jumped right into the gameplay, skipping
            optional settings</li>
          <li>the product seemed to lag from time to time and the user was also confused about certain mechanics based
            on colour coding;</li>
          <li>the user decided to check the settings and found the Video settings where both the performance and the
            colour deficiency problems were both fixed.</li>
          <li>the user now enjoys our product and later he posted a game review praising the producer for the attention
            to both slow-performing devices and colour-deficient users.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>While our product may not always be used in the Primary target personas we have to take into consideration
        potential deficiencies or performance limitations when designing our product, and include options that allow
        more users to enjoy our product.

        </li>
        <li>Detailed Description:</li>
        <p>It is safe to assume that this persona is not what we are looking for, therefore it represents the category

        <p>In the mentions section, it was stated that he does not agree with technology playing an important role in
          one’s life. Taking all these facts into consideration we are going to focus product advertisements on the

        <p>Let us imagine the next series of events:</p>

        <li>Detailed Description:</li>
        <p>This is the Customer Persona, a “ghost” user that most likely purchased our product for someone else. Most
          aspects of what this user likes or dislikes are irrelevant to the production and distribution teams but it
          must be brought to our attention one potential dislike. As it was stated previously the unwillingness to pay
          for “useless” products might make it difficult to convince the individual to even buy our product for someone
          else.</p>
        <p>In the mentions section, it was stated that exceptions to such beliefs are possible if the product seems
          worth purchasing for someone else, very likely from the Primary Persona category.
        </p>
        <li>Scenarios</li>
        <p>Let us imagine the next series of events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The individual is asked to purchase our product for someone who can't purchase it themselves (for example,
            a child).</li>
          <li>The individual tries to look for our product and view any potential reviews, or get a vague sense of what
            our product represents.
          </li>
          <li>Upon closer inspection, the user decides to balance the value of the product with the demanded price.</li>
          <li>After considering the option, the individual decided to purchase our product for the potential primary
            user.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>It is important to advertise our product properly, taking into consideration Customer personas, thus we must
        include mentions that might intrigue and convince potential buyers into purchasing our product.

      <h2 id="functionalRequirements"><span>6. </span>Interaction Types</h2>
      <p>There are going to be 3 main ways for our users to interact with the product, 2 of them being dependent on the
        platform used to host the application and the final one being a toggle option which allows the player to choose
        if he wants to use the interaction and the features it provides.</p>

      <h3 id="register"><span>6.1 </span>Keyboard + Mouse Input</h3>
      <p>
        This interface is used in the desktop device format and it consists of two physical devices:
      <ul>
        <li>The Keyboard is used for movement actions which allow the player to explore and progress through levels. The
          default values for the keyboard actions are W A S D for Forward Strafe-Left Backward Strafe-Right. Two more
          actions can be used through the Keyboard, the Pause Game which is defaulted to the Escape Key, and the
          Map-Device which is defaulted to F. These actions can be modified to custom values by the user in the Settings
          -> Controls Menu.</li>
        <li>The Mouse is used for redirecting the game camera which allows the player to look around the environment of
          the game. Another function of the mouse is to navigate the Menu Screens by clicking on the respective buttons
          and modifying settings for a better user experience.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3 id="login"><span>6.2 </span>Mobile Touch-screen Input</h3>
      <p>
        This is the interaction layer used for hosting the application on mobile devices:
      <ul>
        <li>While the Menu Screens and the overall aspect of the application remain unchanged we are needed to use the
          touch-screen function of the mobile device for interaction.</li>
        <li>The Menu Screens are easily usable by touching the buttons where normally a mouse click would be used.</li>
        <li>For the In-Game part of the application, we need to implement a virtual overlay over the game screen. It
          will consist of:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>two virtual joystick-like controls, the left one used for movement and the right one for looking around;
          </li>
          <li>two small buttons which are used for the Pause Game and the Map-Device functions.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3 typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" role="doc-chapter" id="uploadrecipe"><span>6.3 </span>Audio Input-Output</h3>
      <p>
        This interaction layer has been implemented for the audio mechanic of the game consisting of two ways of
        interaction:
      <ul>
        <li>Audio Input: Given by the player through the microphone component of the hosting device it will immediately
          inform nearby ghosts of the player’s location at the moment of the Audio Input. While this might be viewed as
          a negative only effect, players might strategize and trick ghosts into entering blockades or leaving zones the
          player has to enter in order to progress.</li>
        <li>Audio Output: Given by the nearby ghost through the speaker component of the hosting device, it will inform
          the player of the location of nearby ghosts. This mechanic is useful as it will give the player information
          about, what ghosts are near, how far are they and if they are nearing the player or running away from him.
        </li>
      </ul>
